# JS UI

The no-BS JavaScript front-end framework. We don't stray from the DOM.

# Goals

- No dependencies
- Small bundle size
- Encourage mutability
- Do not impose transpilation in client source code, should be 100% implementable in vanilla JS
- All functionality should be relatively traceable to client source code.
  - Avoid "magic" side-effects.
  - Any framework logic should be explicitly implemented by the developer.

## Nice-to-haves

- Different versions should play well with each other
  - Use-case: three different plugins for a website that use different versions of JS UI
