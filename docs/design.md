# JS UI

The no-BS JavaScript front-end framework. Closer to the metal (or DOM, but "metal" sounds cooler.)

# Goals

- Encourage bound-data mutability
- Do not impose transpilation in client source code, should be 100% implementable in vanilla JS
- All functionality should be relatively traceable to client source code.
  - Avoid "magic" side-effects.
  - Any framework logic should be explicitly implemented by the developer.
